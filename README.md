# Salmon Survival Next

The same game, with new graphics: rebuilt on three.js r186 and WebGPU, one step at a time. It is a work in progress, so some things may look rough while they are being redone. The original stays as it is: [code](https://github.com/tscherrie/salmon-survival) · [play](https://salmon-survival.vercel.app).

Live one salmon's whole life in a Nordic river. Hatch in the gravel of the source, grow up in the brook, go down to the sea with the smolts, and fight your way home to spawn where you were born. On the way: storms and flash floods, an angler's fly, otters, gill nets, a fish ladder, sea lice at the salmon farm, the northern lights.

**Play it in the browser:** https://salmon-survival-next.vercel.app — in English, Deutsch, 中文, 日本語 and Български. It needs a computer with a keyboard and a mouse, and it saves as you play.

Written with Claude Opus 5.5.

## Controls

- Mouse: steer (click the view first)
- `W` swim · `S` brake and hold on to the bottom
- `A` / `D` dodge sideways
- `Space` dash, bite, leap (at the surface: over a waterfall)
- `M` map · `L` logbook · `I` stories and facts · `T` sound · `P` pause (the buttons on the right show while paused)

## Run it yourself

It is a static site with no build step. Serve this folder with any static web server and open it:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Useful for trying things: `?new&stage=parr&at=4500` starts a new parr at a place along the river (`at` is the distance from the source in tenths of a metre), `?event=storm|angler|otters|floes|aurora` starts one of the events at once, `?lang=en|de|zh|ja|bg` picks the language.

## What is where

- `index.html`, `style.css` – the page, the HUD, the start card
- `src/main.js` – the game loop: the fish, the camera, what happens
- `src/course.js` – the river from source to sea: its bed, its level, its current
- `src/terrain.js`, `src/features.js` – the ground, the plants, and the special places (caves, the mill, the bridge, the wreck …)
- `src/forest.js` – the forest on the banks: spruce, pine, birch, juniper, bilberry, ferns (needles and leaves cut out of cards in the shader, with the seasons)
- `src/salmon.js` – the salmon: stages of life, growth, swimming, leaping
- `src/life.js`, `src/predators.js`, `src/rivals.js`, `src/school.js`, `src/brawl.js` – food, shoals, hunters, fights
- `src/events.js` – storms, anglers, otters, ice floes, northern lights
- `src/eddies*.js`, `src/flowfield.js` – the water flowing round stones
- `src/i18n*.js` – the translations (the game is written in German; English, Chinese, Japanese and Bulgarian are laid over it)
- `riverscape/src/`, `shared/`, `ui/` – the water, light, fish and foliage it builds on, from Desktop Habitats (the parts the game uses); `vendor/` – three.js
- `src/dev/shots.js`, `tools/` – photo points: the same scenes pictured and timed for every graphics change (`node tools/shots.mjs <set>`, then `tools/compare.html`)
